Improved Pixel-level Pavement Defects Segmentation Based on Various Loss Functions
  
In this place we store U-Net based neural network implementation used for investigation. It containes model and loss function implementation, using Keras with Tensorflow backend. Another architectures might be derived using this codebase. Few ideas: autoencoders with triple convolutional, quadruple convolutional operation, residual connections.

Investigation is made on CrackForest dataset [1], [2]. Data examples (label is invested for visualization reasons):
